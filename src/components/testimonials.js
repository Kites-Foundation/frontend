              I am happy to note that the Kites Foundation has organised Rang, a virtual youth festival.

              <br/>It is heartening that thousands of participants showcased their talents in literature, performing arts
              and visual arts on a single digital platform. The fact that school and college students as well as seniors
              participated in this festival echoes the wide acceptance that Rang had.

              I have full faith in the initiative 'Punarjjani' by KITES foundation to be as the name states a revival of
              the spirit of agriculture within our society. To see well informed youngsters taking up such an initiative
              is both inspiring and motivating.

              Kites Foundation is indeed a youth collective that is immensely driven by the noble tenets of Dr. APJ
              Abdul Kalam, which is to stay awake, dream big and achieve it through true hardwork , as he says, "Dream
              is not that which you see while sleeping it is something that does not let you sleep.‚Äù

              It's my immense pleasure to be a part of Voice of India by Kites Foundation, where I believe the young
              voices of India are heard. I, as a member of parliament from extreme south, gets an opportunity to speak
              on this platform indeed is the inclusiveness India always has.

              Knowledge becomes valuable, only when we apply it in real-life. Mere theoretical knowledge from books, can
              neither make a better leader nor a better society. Kites Foundation and its activities are highly
              effective in building leaders of tomorrow as it brings knowledge acquired by the youth into practice.<i

              In today's world where quality education becomes a privilege and youth are trained to be self centred, it
              is endearing to see a group of promising youngsters striving for uplifting the society and ensuring and
              enhancing quality education. My heartfelt wishes for KITES foundation to fly high to the sky and beyond!

              It is a very unique step for an NGO to take an initiative in studying the problems of a place, and
              presenting it as a project to the district administration with a goal towards resolving it. Also, it is
              quite appreciable that Kites has been the lead in every stage of execution of the MUNNAR VIBGYOR TOURISM
              project, which is an aid for the tourism development of our country.<i

              You have to take people along , you can't just be yourself and just be career oriented. You have to rise
              above yourself . You have to be the one with larger society and select the section of population who needs
              you , your contribution , your support and commitment.
