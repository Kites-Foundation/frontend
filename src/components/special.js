                      works towards addressing the rural urban-divide. As mental wellness is considered equally
                      important for a healthy and happy living, Ayush seeks to nurture a healthy generation capable of
                      destigmatising mental health issues.</p>
                    <p>Initiatives to raise awareness against stigmas related to health, campaigns to facilitate better
                      disposal of healthcare, projects to bring in health facilities to economically weaker and less
